Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This repository serves as a platform for tracking my progress in technical interview preparation and sharing my solutions, knowledge, and notes on various coding problems. By making my code public, I am holding myself accountable for consistent progress while also contributing to the community's collective knowledge.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this repository are:

1. **Technical Interview Preparation:** This repository contains solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, each of which is commonly encountered in technical interviews. By practicing these problems and maintaining solutions, I am actively honing my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

2. **Accountability:** Making my solutions public motivates me to maintain a consistent practice schedule. The public nature of this repository encourages me to strive for quality solutions and document my thought processes effectively.

3. **Knowledge Sharing:** I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. By openly publishing my solutions, I aim to contribute to the programming community's collective understanding of various problem-solving techniques and strategies.

4. **Learning and Growth:** As I progress through more complex problems and optimize my solutions, this repository will showcase my growth as a programmer. It serves as a timeline of my coding journey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem has its dedicated folder named after its corresponding LeetCode problem number and name.
- Inside each problem folder, you will find:
  - **Solution(s):** Code implementations for the problem in various programming languages.
  - **Explanation:** Detailed explanation of the problem, thought process, and the approach taken for solving it.
  - **Notes:** Personal insights, strategies, and lessons learned from solving the problem.
